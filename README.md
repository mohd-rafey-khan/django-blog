Project Setup:

  We’ll assume you have Django installed already. You can tell Django is installed and which version by running the following command in a shell prompt (indicated by the $ prefix):
  
  $ python -m django --version
  
Creating a project

      If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of some initial setup. 
      Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project– 
      a collection of settings for an instance of Django, 
      including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.
      From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, 
      then run the following command:

  $ django-admin startproject mysite
  
  Otherwise you Should simply git project by using command:
   
    $ git clone 
    
  To Run:
    using cd go into the project folder where manage.py is present and then run
  
   $ python3 manage.py runserver
          
        it will provide link where site is displayed (localhost)
